# Chessosis: Introductory Project Description

## Sarcoidosis, thrombosis, psychosis, Chessosis

Chessosis is a minimalistic chess playing application. It has a simple GUI with few options. The GUI displays a chess board on which the user can make moves with the arrow keys or the mouse. It's possible to set the game up in three ways: two-player mode, player vs computer mode or computer vs computer mode. Two-player mode is mostly just a virtual chess board for two human players. However, the rules of the game are still enforced; neither player can make illegal moves. The computer can play against the user or itself. As far as the JavaLabra course is involved, it's unlikely that any actual artificial intelligence (AI) will be involved in the Chessosis computer opponent. It will just select randomly from the list of legal moves.

The main merit (and project goal) of Chessosis is that it honors and enforces all the rules of chess. I realize that this won't be an easy goal to accomplish. It will involve a lot of testing. Considering that testing is one of the three main topics of the JavaLabra course, this is not really a problem.

Chessosis offers rather limited functionality from the user's point of view. It's unlikely that the user can do much else with the program than use it as a chess board, play against a braindead AI or watch it play against itself. Even so, my intention is to provide an adequately usable GUI. Most importantly this will involve a graphical board that doesn't look obscure or ugly and which is reasonably comfortable to use (to move pieces on).

The limited amount of user functionality is a conscious choice: I will invest more time and energy in creating reliable program logic and data representation than in coming up with fancy external features. That's not to say I won't be adding such features if time permits. For example, the ability to save a game into a file and continue it later on might be quite useful. Another useful feature could be saving a completed game (perhaps between two humans) into a text file in standard algebraic notation.

I intend to make Chessosis stable, well-tested and well-documented enough that I (or someone else) can use it as a foundation for developing and testing chess AI. As said earlier, this is likely to be out of scope of the JavaLabra course.

*Future marketing slogan: Chessosis -- for those who prefer reliability over looks*
