# Hours worked on Chessosis, Henrik Lindberg's JavaLabra project

## 2015-05-13 | Hours worked: 7

Getting started with things can be difficult and confusing. This course seems to be no exception. The first deadline is tomorrow, and the initial tasks involved have to do with preparation. I created a GitHub account for myself. I have no previous experience with GitHub (or Git for that matter) so I spent some time just familiarizing myself with the service.

The JavaLabra pages (https://github.com/javaLabra/Javalabra2015-5) have instructions on how to get things up and running for the actual work on the course. The instructions aren't very well written but are understandable, given some effort. I got my first hands-on experience with using Git through these instructions. Git seems confusing at first but I'm sure I'll grow comfortable with it over time.

Creating the public-private SSH key pair for my computer and GitHub account went fairly well. I haven't used SSH client programs or SSH-based authentication that much before but I suppose I already understand the basic principles involved.

I tried setting up a NetBeans project for my repository using Maven and the PIT testing features. I don't think it went that well although I did get some idea what I'm supposed to accomplish by it. I'll try again tomorrow.

Much of the time I've used today on JavaLabra has involved me just reading the course pages. I want to get a good general idea on what this course is all about, how it is structured and what I am to accomplish during it.

This document is in English as is everything else I intend to write for this project. I believe English is the language of choice for computer science and ICT engineering whereas Finnish is more suitable for expressing great thoughts and deep feelings. Also, my project might turn out to be more useful for others (or for a greater audience) if it is written in English.

I started the day by getting more practice and a general knowledge on Git. I now have a degree of routine involved what comes to the few Git commands needed to work on my GitHub repository. I read Wikipedia's article on Git which obviously enhanced my knowledge and understanding of the program. While typing at the Linux command line I made myself a small reference of the commands I'm likely to need in future Git sessions. Like so:

* `ssh-agent /bin/bash   # Gets rid of the need to type...`
* `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa # ...the passphrase more than once`
* `cd uf/yo1415/javalabra/`
* `git clone 'git@github.com:morgulcore/Chessosis.git'`
* `cd Chessosis/`
* `git status`
* `git add <dir>`
* `git commit -am 'Commit message'`
* `git push`

I suppose my NetBeans project is now set up correctly. At least the were no more error messages when running the PIT thing. I haven't written any actual code for my project yet, although I did create a HELLO WORLD main method. For better or for worse, I think the stage is now set.

I registered for labtool. I suppose my work on Chessosis can and will be monitored by someone from the computer science department from now on. That is the general idea, anyway. Not that I don't realize that the repository is public; in principle, anyone on the Internet can inspect my work.

After completing this entry I'm going to write the topic specification, or whatever "aihemäärittely" is in English.
