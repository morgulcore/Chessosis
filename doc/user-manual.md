# Chessosis user manual

Such as it is now, learning to use Chessosis is a most simple matter. When the game begins, left-click on a piece to see the squares it can move to. Then right-click on one of the highlighted squares to move the piece to it. Middle-clicking on a square will give the square name, its status (the piece on it) and NAM which means the number of available moves in the current position.

Please note that this version of Chessosis has some deficiencies. They are listed in the text area of the GUI when the game begins.

Note that when you make a move it is displayed in the text area.
